# homelab
Repository for the Homelab, using Kubernetes.

This will be a repository for version control of the homelab I am creating using kubernetes. 
This project will be ongoing; I am excited to learn kubernetes and how it can powerfully deploy infrastructure through containersation and code.

## TODO
- create a deployment for my file server
 - yaml files are key
- Get gitops going
- Figure out vault environment variables
